# Twitch-Clip-Viewer
Note: Doesn't properly work anymore since Twitch changed their API in 2018

Grab and search twitch clips from your favorite streamer moments.

First use getClips.py to grab a list of clips and data to a text file from a Twitch channel, then you can use the web page to search any clip.

Note: Might have issues with Google Chrome. Recommended to use firefox instead.
